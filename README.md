### 🚀 About Me

I'm a **young, highly technical builder** focused on **blockchain infrastructure, protocol engineering, and production-grade systems**.

I spend most of my time:

* Designing **on-chain & off-chain architectures**
* Building **Solana-native products**
* Exploring **offline-first crypto systems**
* Shipping **real software**, not demos

I care deeply about **clean architecture, scalability, and correctness**.
