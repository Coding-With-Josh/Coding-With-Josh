### 🚀 About Me

I'm a **young software and blockchain-focused engineer** who enjoys building **real, production-grade systems**.

I spend most of my time:

* Building **backend-heavy applications**
* Working with **Solana wallets, accounts, and off-chain systems**
* Designing **scalable APIs and data models**
* Shipping **actual products**, not tutorials

I care a lot about **clean code, correctness, and architecture that scales**.
